description: Author a modux domain model by editing its YAML files directly — the metamodel in brief, the JSON schema, the referential rules the schema cannot express, and the validate/generate loop. Use when creating or changing a model in a repo's modux/ directory (aggregates, bounded contexts, use cases, relations, workflows), or when `mvn modux:validate` fails.

# Authoring a modux model

A modux model is **a directory of YAML files in the repository**, one file per element,
versioned next to the code it generates. You edit it with Read/Edit/Write like any other
source. There is no server to call and no tool surface in front of the files.

```
mi-proyecto/
├── modux/                          ← the model
│   ├── index.yaml                  ← marker + counts per type. Its presence is what makes
│   │                                 this directory a modux project.
│   ├── model-driven-store-schema.json
│   ├── project.yaml
│   ├── boundedContexts/{id}.yaml
│   ├── aggregates/{id}.yaml
│   └── …                           ← one directory per element type
└── src/main/java/                  ← generated + hand-written
```

**One repository is one project.** There is no "current project" to select.

## Start here: the schema is the metamodel

`modux/model-driven-store-schema.json` defines every element type and every field — what
can be said at all. **Read it before inventing a field**; a field that is not in the schema
does not exist, and the generator will ignore it silently.

Regenerate it after upgrading modux:

```bash
mvn modux:schema
```

## The shape of the metamodel

Three layers that are easy to conflate:

| Concept | What it owns |
|---|---|
| **Bounded context** | **Meaning.** The domain language: aggregates, use cases, domain events. |
| **Module** | **Packaging.** How a context's elements are distributed into buildable units. |
| **Service** | **Deployment.** A service deploys modules; it is what becomes a runnable app. |

A bounded context is born with a **main module** (`{contextId}-main`), and a service deploys
that module. If you add a context by hand, add its main module too, and add the module's id to
a service's `moduleIds` — otherwise the context exists but nothing deploys it.

## The rules the schema cannot express

The schema guards shape. These are the ones that break a model while still validating:

1. **Every id reference must resolve.** Any field ending in `Id` or `Ids` must name an element
   that exists in the model. This is the single most common breakage from a hand edit.
   The one exception is `referencedRepositoryId`, which is legacy and points outside the model —
   see «Referencing another project» below. The schema says so on the field itself.
2. **Back-references are two-way.** An aggregate declares nothing about its context; the
   *context* lists it in `aggregateIds`. Adding `aggregates/agg-x.yaml` without adding `agg-x`
   to its context's `aggregateIds` produces an orphan the editor will not draw.
   The same holds for `useCaseIds`, `valueObjectIds` and `services.moduleIds`.
3. **An aggregate needs its state model.** Aggregates carry `modelId` pointing at a `models/`
   element. The convention is `model-{aggregate id without the `agg-` prefix}`.
4. **Deletion has preconditions.** A bounded context with aggregates, or an aggregate with
   entities, cannot be deleted until those go first.
5. **A module is deployed by exactly one service.** Do not list the same module id under two
   services.
6. **Invariants are nested, and polymorphic.** They live inside their owner's `invariants`
   list, and the owner may be an aggregate, a value object *or* an entity — not in a
   top-level directory.
7. **Sagas and workflows have an execution ceiling per step.** A cycle without a bound is
   rejected: the build refuses workflows that can loop forever.
8. **A workflow must be startable from a bounded context.** It lives outside every context, but
   its generated definition has to end up on some running service's classpath — so it needs a
   trigger (`triggerAggregateId`, `triggerDomainServiceId` or `triggerUseCaseId`) naming
   something a context owns, or at least one step with a `targetUseCaseId`. Without that it
   generates nothing at all. `triggerEvent` alone is NOT enough: it says what starts the
   workflow, not from where.

## Workflows speak EventConductor's language

A workflow is run by [EventConductor](https://eventconductor.mateu.io/), and modux generates its
definition — so the engine's vocabulary is the one the model uses. A step's `type` is one of
EventConductor's own:

`START` · `ACTION` · `JOIN` · `FORK` · `END` · `USER_TASK` · `PROCESS` · `TIMER` ·
`WAIT_FOR_MESSAGE` · `SEND_MESSAGE` · `RULE`

Two things follow that are easy to get wrong by hand:

- **A step with a `roleId` or a `formPageId` is a `USER_TASK`**, not an `ACTION`. Leave `type`
  out and it is inferred from exactly that; write `ACTION` on a step with a role and you have
  told the engine a person's task is automated work.
- **modux says `dependsOnStepIds`, the engine says preconditions.** Same edge; the translation
  happens at generation, so declare dependencies the modux way.

An older model saying `TASK` or `SPLIT` is migrated on load (`SPLIT` → `FORK`). The schemas
themselves live in `model-driven-generator/src/main/resources/eventconductor/`, copied from
EventConductor — when the two disagree, the one that is wrong is modux.

## Referencing another project

A repository holds one project, so referencing another project is referencing another repository.
It appears in this model as an `externalSystems/` element carrying two different things, and the
difference is the whole point:

- a **snapshot** — the other project's name and its exposed use cases, copied in. This is what
  generation reads, which is why a build never needs the other repository present. Do not
  hand-maintain it; it is refreshed from the source.
- a **coordinate**, `referencedProject`, saying where that source is:

```yaml
referencedProject:
  gitUrl: git@github.com:acme/checkin.git   # the identity — means the same to everyone
  branch: main                              # optional
  path: ../../checkin/modux                 # optional: only when the checkout is not a sibling
```

Prefer `gitUrl` alone. A sibling checkout is found from it with no network and nothing configured,
and unlike a path it does not encode where *your* machine keeps things. `path` is an override.

`referencedRepositoryId` on the same element is the old form — an id into `~/.modux/repositories.yaml`,
a file that lived on one machine. Never write it. A model still carrying it is migrated on load
where that registry survives; where it does not, the snapshot still stands and only refreshing is
lost.

## The loop

Always, after editing:

```bash
mvn modux:validate     # referential integrity — catches rules 1 and 2 above
mvn modux:generate     # generates into the project's declared outputPath
mvn -q test            # the generated code has to build
```

`modux:validate` reports every dangling reference with the element and field that carries it.
Fix the model, not the generated code.

## Do not edit generated code

Generation has two zones (see `docs/design/two-zone-codegen.md`):

- **Generated zone** — overwritten on every run. Never edit it; the change is lost on the next
  `modux:generate`.
- **Custom zone** (`{service}-custom`) — scaffolded once, never overwritten. Business logic
  goes here, implementing the hooks the generated zone declares.

If you want different generated code, change the model or the template — not the output.

## Conventions that keep diffs small

- **File names come from ids**, sanitized (`[^A-Za-z0-9._-]` → `_`). Two ids differing only by
  a special character collide in one file.
- **The store never writes empty values**: no nulls, no empty strings, no empty lists, and
  `false` booleans are omitted. Do not add `aggregateIds: []` — leave the field out.
- **Element order inside a type is not meaningful.** Files load alphabetically. Order *within*
  an element (a use case's steps) is meaningful and preserved.
- Ids are conventionally prefixed by type: `bc-`, `agg-`, `ent-`, `vo-`, `uc-`, `model-`.

## Worked examples

`sample/patterns/` in the modux repository holds hand-authored didactic models, one per
pattern — BFF, ACL, CQRS, event-driven, saga, event sourcing, human process. Read the one that
matches the shape you are building before writing from scratch.
`sample/hla-booking/` is a full realistic model.

## When the editor is the better tool

Geometry (`diagrams/`) is written by the graphical editor in the IntelliJ plugin. You can edit
it by hand, but positions you invent will look arbitrary — prefer leaving the diagram alone and
letting auto-layout place new elements.
