## The Modux domain model

Modux organises your system as a hierarchy of concepts:

```
Project
├── Bounded Context (owns the meaning)
│   └── Module (packaging — every context has a main one)
│       ├── Aggregate
│       │   ├── Entity
│       │   ├── Value Object
│       │   ├── Operation
│       │   └── Domain Event
│       ├── Saga
│       ├── Projection / Read Model
│       ├── Subscription
│       ├── Scheduled Trigger
│       ├── Role
│       └── Infrastructure adapters
│           ├── Outbound: Gateway
│           └── Inbound (UI): Page, Component, UI Adapter, UI Shell
└── Service (microservice) — deploys Modules
```

A **Bounded Context** owns the meaning: aggregates, use cases, events, invariants. A **Module** is the buildable unit inside a context (each context is born with one main module). A **Service** is the deployable: it deploys modules via `moduleIds` — the only link between topology and content.

In hexagonal architecture the UI is an **inbound (driving) adapter** — it sits in the infrastructure layer alongside outbound adapters like Gateways. Pages, Components, UI Adapters and UI Shells are simply the inbound side of that same adapter layer.

Each level has its own configuration and generates its own code artefacts.

Above these building blocks, a [**Flow**](/manual/flows/) lets you declare a cross-context interaction by intent (e.g. "this event materializes a read model over there") and have Modux derive the events, projections, subscriptions and sagas it implies — so you rarely wire them by hand.

## Navigating the UI

The Modux UI is organised into six sections, accessible from the left sidebar:

| Section | Contents |
|---|---|
| **Organization** | Projects, Services, Bounded Contexts, Modules |
| **Domain Model** | Aggregates, Entities, Value Objects |
| **Behaviour** | Operations, Use Cases |
| **Async** | Domain Events, Sagas, Projections, Subscriptions, Scheduled Triggers |
| **Interfaces** | Gateways (outbound), Read Models, Pages, Components, UI Adapters, UI Shells (inbound) |
| **Security** | Roles |

## Typical workflow

1. Create a **Project** with your package name and output path
2. Add one or more **Services** (one per microservice)
3. Add **Bounded Contexts** and wire each context's main module into a service
4. Define **Aggregates** with their fields, operations, and events
5. Add **Sagas**, **Projections**, and **Gateways** as needed
6. Click **Generate Code** to produce the full Spring Boot project
7. Implement the generated interfaces with your custom business logic
8. Re-run generation at any time — custom code files are not overwritten
