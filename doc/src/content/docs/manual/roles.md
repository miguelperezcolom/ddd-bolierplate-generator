description: Role-based access control in Modux
---

Modux generates **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** definitions for your application. Roles define what operations each type of user can perform.

## Creating a role

1. Open a bounded context and go to **Roles** (under the Security section)
2. Click **New**
3. Configure and save

## Configuration

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Role name (e.g. `ADMIN`, `BOOKING_MANAGER`, `READ_ONLY`) |
| **Description** | What this role represents |
| **Permissions** | List of allowed operations for this role |

### Permissions

Permissions reference operations defined on your aggregates:

| Permission format | Example |
|---|---|
| `{aggregate}:create` | `booking:create` |
| `{aggregate}:update` | `booking:update` |
| `{aggregate}:delete` | `booking:delete` |
| `{aggregate}:{operation}` | `booking:confirmBooking` |
| `{aggregate}:read` | `booking:read` |
| `*` | All operations (admin) |

## What gets generated

For a `BOOKING_MANAGER` role:

- Role constant in a `Roles.java` class
- Spring Security method security annotations on the relevant use cases
- Role-to-permission mapping configuration

## IAM integration

If your project has an IAM provider configured (e.g. Keycloak), Modux generates:

- Realm role definitions
- Role-to-permission mapping
- JWT claim extraction configuration

The generated Spring Security configuration reads roles from the JWT token and maps them to the permissions defined here.

## Securing operations

Permissions are automatically applied to generated use cases:

```java
@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('booking:confirmBooking')")
public void execute(ConfirmBookingCommand command) {
    // ...
}
```

You can override or extend these annotations in your custom implementations.

- Configure IAM integration in your [Project](/manual/projects/) settings
