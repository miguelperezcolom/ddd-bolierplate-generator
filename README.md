# Modux

**Modux** is a model-driven code generation framework for Domain-Driven Design (DDD) systems. Define your domain model using YAML files and let Modux generate the full Java boilerplate — aggregates, use cases, repositories, UI, and database migrations — so you can focus on business logic.

## What it does

You write a YAML specification describing your domain (aggregates, entities, value objects, events, operations…) and Modux generates a production-ready Spring Boot application with:

- Domain layer: aggregate roots, entities, value objects, domain events
- Application layer: use cases (create/update/delete), query services, DTOs
- Infrastructure layer: JPA entities, Spring Data repositories, DB implementations
- UI layer: auto-generated CRUD pages (Vaadin / Mateu UIDL)
- Database migrations: DDL files, foreign key scripts
- DevOps artifacts: Dockerfile, Docker Compose, Kubernetes manifests, Terraform skeleton, CI workflow (GitHub Actions), JaCoCo coverage

The generated code follows **Hexagonal Architecture** (ports & adapters) with clear separation between domain, application, and infrastructure.

---

## Architecture patterns supported

- **DDD** — Aggregates, entities, value objects, domain events, invariants
- **CQRS** — Separate command handlers and query services
- **Event Sourcing** — Optional per aggregate, with snapshot support
- **Saga Pattern** — Choreography/orchestration with compensations and retries
- **Projections & Read Models** — Event-driven denormalized views
- **Outbox Pattern** — Transactional outboxing for reliable messaging
- **RBAC** — Role-based access control definitions
- **Gateway** — External service call definitions with circuit breakers and rate limiting
- **Scheduled Triggers** — Cron-based task definitions

## Project modules

| Module | Description |
|---|---|
| `model-driven-generator` | Main Spring Boot application with UI for defining specs and generating code |
| `plugin` | Maven plugin skeleton (experimental) |
| `sample/poc-sagas` | Example application demonstrating sagas and Kafka integration |
| `io` | Shared UIDL field type definitions |

---

## Domain model overview

A **Project** contains one or more **Bounded Contexts** — each born with a main **Module**, the buildable unit — and one or more **Services** (microservices) that deploy those modules. Each bounded context contains:

- **Aggregates** — DDD aggregate roots with fields, operations, invariants, and events
- **Entities** — Domain entities belonging to an aggregate
- **Value Objects** — Immutable typed wrappers (e.g. `BookingId`, `Email`)
- **Domain Events** — Events emitted by aggregates
- **Use Cases** — Application services
- **Sagas** — Multi-step workflows with compensation logic
- **Projections** — Event handlers that maintain Read Models
- **Gateways** — External service definitions
- **Subscriptions** — Message handlers with filtering and retry policies
- **Scheduled Triggers** — Cron-based tasks
- **Roles** — RBAC role definitions
- **Context Map Relations** — Relationships between bounded contexts (Shared Kernel, ACL, Open Host Service, etc.)

## Run it

The same binary runs against your disk or against a database — see
[deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md) for the full story:

- `./install.sh` builds the jar and drops a `modux` launcher in `~/.local/bin`
  that works against `~/.modux` (→ `http://localhost:8192`; `MODUX_PORT` /
  `MODUX_HOME` to vary).
- `./install.sh --docker` builds the runtime image instead and the launcher runs
  the container with `~/.modux` mounted as home. The [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile)
  is runtime-only: the jar is built on the host, because the mateu
  `0.0.1-MATEU` artifacts are not published yet.
- The Helm chart [`deploy/chart/modux`](deploy/chart/modux) deploys modux
  together with Bitnami PostgreSQL (`postgresql.enabled=false` plus
  `externalDatabase.jdbcUrl` to point at an external database). The first boot
  against a database seeds the repositories catalog — `MODUX_BOOTSTRAP_DB` with
  `MODUX_DB_USER` / `MODUX_DB_PASSWORD`.

### In-app chat, no API key

Modux's shell is annotated `@AI(sse = "/mateu/agent/stream")` and depends on
`io.mateu:agent-cli`: on a machine with the `claude` or `gemini` CLI on the
PATH, the app gets a chat with **no API key** — the pseudo-agent bridges the
developer's own CLI. This is a local-development convenience; a server exposed
to others should point `@AI` at a real agent instead. The chat renders markdown
including inline SVG and images (as of the paired mateu release), so the agent
can show the output of MCP tools like `render_context_map` right in the
conversation.

## Getting started

### 1. Run the generator

The comfortable way (builds once, installs the `modux` launcher):

```bash
./install.sh
modux
```

Open `http://localhost:8192` in your browser. For development straight from the
sources, `cd model-driven-generator && mvn spring-boot:run` serves the same app
on the same port. Docker and Kubernetes (Helm) deployments are covered in
[deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md).

### 2. Define your domain

Use the UI to create:

1. **Project** — name, package, output path
2. **Services** — one per microservice
3. **Bounded Contexts** — each is born with a main module; wire it into a service's modules
4. **Aggregates** — domain objects with fields, operations, and events

### 3. Generate code

Click **Generate Code**. The project is written to the configured output directory, ready to build and run.

### 4. Add your business logic

The generated code is designed to be extended:

- Implement generated interfaces in separate Maven modules
- Fill in abstract methods
- Provide Spring beans for custom logic
- The generator can be run again without overwriting your custom code (configurable per file)
